# Chapter 1: The Brain Sound Map and the International Phonetic Alphabet

## Introduction

Learning the correct pronunciation of a new language can be a challenging task. One thing that makes it hard is when the letters of the language you are learning do not always have a one-to-one mapping to the sounds of that language. Another way pronunciation is hard is when the sounds of the language you are learning don't even exist in your native tongue. For devs, one of the most powerful tools to overcome these challenges is the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA.


## Inconsistencies in Spelling Systems

Even though they use the same symbols, the letters of English have different sounds than the letters of Spanish. For example, the **"r"** in the English word **"ring"** is different from the **"r"** in the Spanish word **"rey".** Furthermore, there is inconsistency in English spelling, as the same letter often represents different sounds.

**Vowel Inconsistencies:**

Take for example the vowel **"o"**, which represents different sounds in different words:

<pre style="background: #282a36; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; font-family: 'Monaco', 'Consolas', monospace; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; overflow-x: auto;">
<span style="color: #ff79c6; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #8be9fd;">exampleOne</span> <span style="color: #bd93f9;">=</span> <span style="color: #bd93f9;">{</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"to"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/tu/"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">,</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"so"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/soʊ/"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">,</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"on"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/ɑn/"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">,</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"of"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/ʌv/"</span>
<span style="color: #bd93f9;">};</span>
</pre>

**Consonant Inconsistencies:**

Similarly, consonants like **"c"** represent different sounds in different words:

<pre style="background: #282a36; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; font-family: 'Monaco', 'Consolas', monospace; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; overflow-x: auto;">
<span style="color: #ff79c6; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #8be9fd;">exampleTwo</span> <span style="color: #bd93f9;">=</span> <span style="color: #bd93f9;">{</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"cat"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/k/"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">,</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"city"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/s/"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">,</span>
  <span style="color: #f1fa8c;">"child"</span><span style="color: #bd93f9;">:</span> <span style="color: #50fa7b;">"/tʃ/"</span>
<span style="color: #bd93f9;">};</span>
</pre>

The examples above show how single letters can be pronounced with completely different sounds. Unfortunately, these examples show that you cannot rely on the letters or graphemes of English, in order to know how the word is spoken. Instead, we need to go above graphemes and instead rely on phonemes.

## The International Phonetic Alphabet

English, Spanish, Nahuatl, Portuguese, and many other world languages all use an alphabet derived from Latin. However, as we saw in the previous section, even though the languages use the same symbols, those symbols represent different sounds. For example, the English "h" sound in "*house*" is spelled with a "j" in Spanish, as in the word, "jornada".

In the late 19th century, a group of French and English teachers set out to devise a consistent spelling system to teach their languages. This system came to be known as the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA. The goal of the IPA was to create a single symbol for each speech sound in all human languages.

Today, the IPA has approximately 157 symbols. All the sounds in all human languages can be represented with just 157 symbols. Amazing, right! That includes those throaty consonants of Arabic [χ], the click sounds of South African Xhosa [ǃ], the tones of tone languages like Thai, and the "tl" sound of Nahuatl [ł]. Every language's phonology is a closed system, meaning there are a finite number of sounds to learn. Once you master all the sounds of the English IPA, you can pronounce any word in English!

The IPA has its limitations. Human speech varies considerably. You are able to distinguish the voices of people you know because each individual pronounces things slightly differently, even speakers of the same language. Voices change over the course of a life – a young voice is different from an old voice. Your voice even varies over the course of a day – your voice when you first wake up does not sound the same as it does in the evening. The IPA does its best to capture and represent the essential sounds of human language in a standardized way, but it lacks perfect precision.

## IPA Vowel Symbols of English

Spelling vowels and vowel-like sounds in English can be tricky. American English contains 15 distinct vowel and vowel-like sounds, and while there is some consistency in how these sounds are spelled, there is also significant variation. For now, take a quick look at the IPA vowel symbols and their example words. We'll explore vowels in greater detail in the following chapter.

| IPA Symbol  | Example Word |
| :---- | :---- |
| `[a]` | J**a**va d**o**c |
| `[æ]` | fl**a**sk **a**pp |
| `[ʌ] / [ə]` | b**u**g h**u**nt |
| `[ɔɪ]` | depl**oy** a j**oi**n |
| `[aʊ]` | cl**ou**d |
| `[eɪ]` | s**ay** arr**ay** |
| `[ɛ]` | **e**d t**e**ch |
| `[ɝ]` | s**er**v**er** |
| `[aɪ]` | r**i**ght b**i**te |
| `[ɪ]` | g**i**t comm**i**t |
| `[i]` | l**ea**n t**ea**m |
| `[oʊ]` | n**o**de |
| `[ʊ]` | h**oo**k |
| `[u]` | Bl**ue**t**oo**th |
| `/l/` | **l**ong po**ll** |

In the table above, we have included some relevant words from the tech industry that highlight the different vowel and vowel-like sounds. These are the most important sounds in order to improve pronunciation. In order to make this easier and more fun, we have developed the Sound Brain Map, a pedagogical tool to help you learn about the different sounds of language.

## The Sound Brain Map

*[Sound Brain Map diagram would appear here]*

The sound brain map is intentionally designed to showcase how moving your tongue up and down, forward and background is how we make different vowel sounds. The IPA uses a similar chart.

### Exercise

Put your hand on your chin as you say "lean team", keep your hand on your chin, and say "flask app". Do you see how your tongue is lower when you say "flask app" vs. "lean team". Now do the same thing but switch between "lean team" and "bluetooth". Do you see how your tongue moves forward and backward? Practicing this shows how your tongue can either be forward or backward.

You can develop metalinguistic awareness if you understand this at a deep and personal physical level, you should try making the noises yourself. The IPA is set up in a way that resembles the cartesian plane, where the y variable is tongue height and the x variable is tongue frontness. You can see this in the following diagrams.

As you can see, the Sound Brain Map is set up in a similar way. The Sound Brain Map is created in a similar way where the vowels are positioned high, low, front and back.

One more concept to learn is the difference between a monophthong and a diphthong. A monophthong is a vowel that has one sound, like `/i/`, if you try making this sound, then you will notice your tongue stays in the same position. A diphthong has a vowel that is dynamic and changing. Say "Price spiked" in English for Ay, ay, ay in Spanish for the monophthong `[ai]`, you will see how your tongue changes.

The sound brain map shows the 15 vowel and vowel-like sounds of the English language. Spanish has a smaller set of sounds. The following chart shows the sounds on the Sound Brain Map that have an equivalent sound in Spanish.

## Sound Brain Map with Spanish Equivalents

*[Sound Brain Map with Spanish equivalents diagram would appear here]*

The word `/i/`, as in "lean team" also exists in Spanish, for example "s**í** s**e**ñor". The sound `/ei/` also exists in Spanish, as in "s**ei**s". The sound `/ɛ/` "ed tech" as in "t**e**cnología". On the other hand, you can see there are six sounds which do not exist in English at all, you can see this in the following example.

| Sound | English example | Trick to remember |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `/oʊ/` | node | The "gringou" sound |
| `/ɪ/` | git commit | The almost `/i/` sound |
| `/ɝ/` | server | The pirate sound |
| `/æ/` | flask app | The baby sound |
| `/ʊ/` | hook | The almost "u" sound |
| `/ə/` | bug/hunt | The lazy sound |

### /oʊ/ – The "gringou" sound

This diphthong appears in words like *"node,"* *"go,"* or *"code."* For Spanish speakers, it can resemble an exaggerated or stereotypical accent — hence, "gringou." Unlike the flat Spanish *o*, /oʊ/ glides from one sound to another, starting with a rounded *o* and ending closer to a *ʊ*. Thinking of a dramatic, mock-English "gringou" can help learners exaggerate the glide until it becomes natural.

### `/ɪ/` – The almost `/i/` sound

In words like *"git commit"* or *"bit,"* English uses `/ɪ/`, which is shorter and more relaxed than the Spanish *i*. Native Spanish speakers often pronounce it too narrowly, like `/i/`. The trick is to imagine saying *i* with a tired face — lazy lips and a looser tongue. It's almost *i*, but not quite. Like a half-hearted smile.

### `/ɝ/` – The pirate sound

Found in *"server,"* *"bird,"* and *"learn,"* this is the classic American English "r-colored" vowel. There's no equivalent in Spanish. One effective memory trick is the pirate cliché — "Arrr!" The sound comes from the throat with the tongue bunched up toward the middle of the mouth. Channel your inner pirate, and you're halfway there.

### `/æ/` – The baby sound

Words like *"flask"* or *"cat"* contain `/æ/`, a bright, open front vowel that doesn't exist in Spanish. It's similar to a baby's exaggerated "aaaah" when crying — loud, open, and dramatic. To get it right, learners can mimic a baby's voice or a mock tantrum. It's a bit silly, but it helps loosen up the jaw and lips for proper production.

### `/ʊ/` – The almost "u" sound

Heard in *"hook"* or *"book,"* this sound sits between the Spanish *u* and something more neutral. It's short and rounded but not as tight or deep as *u*. Think of it as saying "oo" but quickly and without tension — like a confused "uh?" that still keeps the lips round. It's the *u* that doesn't try too hard.

### `/ə/` – The lazy sound

Known as the *schwa*, `/ə/` is the most common vowel in English and appears in unstressed syllables like *"bug,"* *"about,"* or *"problem."* It's completely relaxed — the lazy sound. There's no direct equivalent in Spanish, which tends to pronounce every vowel clearly. To mimic `/ə/`, learners should try saying a barely-there "uh" with zero effort — like mumbling through a boring story.

Notice how one of these new sounds is in the middle of the Sound Brain Map. This sound is known as schwa, and it is arguably one of the most important sounds to master in English. The reason this sound is in the center highlights it's importance but it is also intentionally in the middle of the Brain Sound Map in order to because it is the lazy vowel, the tongue is neither high nor low, forward or backwards when saying this sound.

## Conclusion

Mastering the Sound Brain Map and learning the IPA provides you with a powerful tool to accurately pronounce English words, bridging the gap between unfamiliar sounds and your native language. By understanding and applying these tools to English pronunciation, you will have the fundamentals to learn better English pronunciation.
