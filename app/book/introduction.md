# Introduction

*This book is designed for Spanish-speaking developers who want to master English pronunciation for professional communication.*

Learning the correct pronunciation of a new language can be a challenging task. One thing that makes it hard is when the letters of the language you are learning do not always have a one-to-one mapping to the sounds of that language. Another way pronunciation is hard is when the sounds of the language you are learning don't exist in your native tongue. For any language learner, one of the most powerful tools to overcome these challenges is the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA.

The IPA is a standardized system of symbols that represent the sounds of all human languages. It provides a clear, consistent way to understand and reproduce the correct pronunciation of words, regardless of how they are spelled. By learning the IPA, you can avoid common pronunciation pitfalls and confidently pronounce English words with accuracy.

In this book, you will learn how the IPA works and how it can be applied specifically to learning English. You will also learn about the Sound Brain Map, as a pedagogical tool that we developed which makes using the IPA easier and more fun. We will explore how the IPA symbols used in the Sound Brain Map correspond to the sounds of English, and how these differ from the sounds of Spanish. You don't need to become an expert in writing the IPA, but recognizing the symbols and being able to read words written in the IPA will greatly improve your pronunciation.
