## [SLIDE 1: Title] - VoiceCard AI (0:00)

**Opening (30 seconds)**
Don't say anything, just ride off the inroduction

**Brief Hook (30 seconds)**  
I used to be a language teacher, for me and my students, phrasal verbs were always one of the most challenging aspects of acquiring English vocabularly. And the consequences of not mastering phrasal verbs often has an oversized negative impact on speaking skills.

## [SLIDE 2: Problem Section] - The Problem (1:00)

** The Complexity of Phrasal Verbs (30 seconds)**
Walk through point

**[NEXT SLIDE: 1:30]**

**[SLIDE 3: Why Difficult] - Comparison (1:30)**
Let me show you why. In Spanish, "recoger" always means "to pick up." Simple, logical, predictable. But in English, "pick up" has twelve different meanings. You can pick up objects, pick up skills, pick up the phone, or pick up speed. For a Spanish speaker, this feels completely random.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 2:00]**

**[SLIDE 4: Scale] - The Numbers (2:00)**
The scale of this challenge is massive. There are over 2,000 common phrasal verbs in English. They appear in 80% of everyday conversation. And research shows they take 15 times longer to master than regular verbs.

## [SLIDE 5: Success] - My Personal Success (2:30)

**Personal Story (1 minute)**
I built VoiceCard AI to solve my own problem. As a Spanish speaker, my phrasal verb accuracy was stuck at 40%. Traditional methods weren't working. After developing this AI-powered practice system, I increased my accuracy to 85%. Native speakers now tell me I sound "more natural," and I reduced my learning time by 60%.

This personal transformation showed me the power of AI-guided conversation practice tailored specifically for Spanish speakers.

## [SLIDE 6: Target Audience] - Spanish Speakers (3:30)

**Market Introduction (30 seconds)**
So who exactly are we serving? Spanish speakers learning English represent a massive, underserved market.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 4:00]**

**[SLIDE 7: Market Size] - The Numbers (4:00)**
The numbers are compelling. 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide, with 41 million in the US alone. The global language learning market is projected to reach $60 billion by 2027.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 4:30]**

**[SLIDE 8: Why Spanish Speakers] - Specific Challenges (4:30)**
But why focus specifically on Spanish speakers? Four key reasons:

First, cognitive interference - Spanish sentence structure directly conflicts with phrasal verb patterns, creating unique learning challenges.

Second, there's an educational gap. Most ESL materials treat all learners the same, ignoring Spanish-specific difficulties.

Third, economic motivation is high. Research shows phrasal verb fluency correlates with 23% higher salaries for bilingual professionals.

Fourth, it's an underserved market. No existing AI solution specifically targets this Spanish-English language pair.

## [SLIDE 9: Solution Demo Placeholder] - Live Demo (5:30)

**Demo Transition (30 seconds)**
Now let me show you VoiceCard AI in action. I'm going to switch to a live screen share to demonstrate the actual product.

**[SWITCH TO SCREEN SHARE - LIVE DEMO: 6:00-10:00]**

*During live demo, showcase:*
- Voice card selection and context
- Real-time AI conversation 
- Spanish-specific explanations
- Immediate feedback system
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Progress tracking

**Demo Highlights to Mention:**
- "Notice how the AI explains in Spanish, using familiar concepts"
- "The system adapts to Spanish-specific pronunciation patterns"  
- "Watch how it provides immediate, contextual correction"
- "The spaced repetition ensures long-term retention"

## [SLIDE 10: Infrastructure] - System Architecture (10:00)

**Architecture Overview (30 seconds)**
Now let's look under the hood. VoiceCard AI uses a sophisticated real-time architecture combining the best AI services.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 10:30]**

**[SLIDE 11: Overall Architecture] - High Level (10:30)**
At the highest level, our Next.js web application connects users to LiveKit rooms where our Python AI agent orchestrates the conversation. The agent coordinates three specialized AI services: OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for language understanding, Deepgram Nova-3 for speech-to-text, and Cartesia for natural text-to-speech.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 11:00]**

**[SLIDE 12: Voice Pipeline] - Real-time Flow (11:00)**  
Here's the real-time voice processing flow. When a user explains a phrasal verb in Spanish, Deepgram converts speech to text, GPT-4o-mini analyzes the explanation's accuracy and provides Spanish-language feedback, then Cartesia converts that feedback to natural speech. This entire cycle happens in under 2 seconds.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 11:30]**

**[SLIDE 13: Learning Algorithm] - SRS Flow (11:30)**
The learning algorithm implements spaced repetition science. After each practice session, the system updates scheduling based on performance, ensuring struggling phrasal verbs appear more frequently while mastered ones fade into long-term review cycles.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 12:00]**

**[SLIDE 14: Tech Stack] - Technologies (12:00)**
The technology stack combines proven, scalable solutions. Next.js 15 and React 19 for the frontend, LiveKit for real-time communication, and a Python backend using UV for fast dependency management. Everything is containerized and deployment-ready.

## [SLIDE 15: Conclusion] - The Impact (12:30)

**Impact Summary (30 seconds)**
Let me summarize the impact we're creating.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 13:00]**

**[SLIDE 16: Impact Details] - Results (13:00)**
For learners, we're delivering 60% faster learning, 85% accuracy improvement, and the confidence to speak naturally. For the market, we're addressing 559 million potential users in a $60 billion space with first-mover advantage using scalable AI technology.

**[NEXT SLIDE: 13:30]**

**[SLIDE 17: Next Steps] - Future (13:30)**
Our next steps are clear. We're launching a beta with 100 Spanish-speaking users to gather learning effectiveness data. Then we'll expand to other language pairs and partner with educational institutions.

**Closing (30 seconds)**
VoiceCard AI isn't just another language learning app. It's a specialized solution that understands the unique challenges Spanish speakers face with English phrasal verbs, powered by the latest AI technology to deliver personalized, effective practice.

Thank you. I'm happy to take questions.
