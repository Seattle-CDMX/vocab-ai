**Brief Hook (20 seconds)**  
For anyone learning English as a second or foreign language, mastering phrasal verbs is a big hurdle on the way to achieving advanced fluency. For students, grokking these tricky-to-learn, multi-word verbs, like "pick up," "run into," or "put off", "set about" or "pull forward"â€” is the secret sauce to levelling up their spoken English.


## [SLIDE 2: The Complexity of Phrasal Verbs] - The Problem (1:00)

**The Complexity Breakdown (1 minute)**
Phrasal verbs are complex. First, they're multi-word with multiple meanings - "to go on" can mean "to happen" or "to continue." Second, the parts don't equal the whole - "break up" meaning "end a relationship" has nothing to do with physically breaking something upward. Third, they have complex grammar rules - you can say "turn on the TV" or "turn it on," but you can't say "look it after" for "look after it." Finally, they're the secret sauce of spoken English - the difference between formal "Please tolerate the noise" and casual "Just put up with it."

**[SLIDE 3: The Language Learning Market] - Why Current Products Fall Short (0:45)**
Learning phrasal verbs is challenging, as is mastering vocabulary in any second language. Language schools typically focus on reading and grammar, providing insufficient instruction in vocabulary and speaking, let alone phrasal verbs.

Students often turn to flash card based apps like Anki or WaniKani for Japanese Kanji. However, these apps are text-only and lack AI features by default. Of course, there's Duolingo, but these kinds of apps are focused on comprehensive language learning solutions and leave opportunities open for other more niche apps.

I created VoiceCard to help language learners master phrasal verbs and English vocabulary by combining the proven method of spaced repetition with newer techniques in conversational AI.

## [SLIDE 4: First Target: Spanish Speakers in Global Business] - Target Audience (00:30)


 I decided to focus this app on native Spanish speakers learning English in the global business community. This market segment represents people who work with U.S. and Canadian companies as part of the current nearshoring boom, but also participate in the global business community using English with native speakers of other languages. For this market segment, there is a direct correlation between English fluency and career advancement.

**Demo Transition (30 seconds)**

**Final Message (30 seconds)**
For Voice Card, I'm not trying to replace spaced repetition, and I'm not trying to create an all encompassing app that promoises to deliver fluency in the shortest amount of time possible. Instead I'm taking a battle tested, science based technique that millions of learners use every day to learn vocabulalry, and trying to make it more engaging with conversational AI.
