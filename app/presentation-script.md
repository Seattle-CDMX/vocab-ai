**Brief Hook** 
Anybody software developer in Mexico can write a perfect email or slack message in English using an LLLM. Reading and listening? No problem. They've already spent hours pouring over documentation and watching technical tutorials in English. What really sets people apart—or holds them back—is speaking. I'm building Voice Card to help developers in Mexico double their salary.


**User Persona (40 seconds)**  
Meet Roberto, a 29-year-old React Native engineer from Oaxaca, Mexico. He's been programming every day since he was 13-years-old. Roberto reads and writes English every day—he’s great at understanding documentation and can chat on Slack without a problem. But when it comes to speaking, he freezes. He worries about his accent, gets stuck searching for the right words, and dreads video calls with international clients. Roberto knows that if he could speak English more confidently, he could land better jobs, lead projects, and double his salary. He just needs a way to practice real conversations applicable to his job, and efficiently level up his speaking and pronunciation.


**Why Current Products Fall Short**
Speaking and pronunciation is hard.

A lot of developers have a unique linguistic profile: high reading and listening skills, but low speaking skills. My hypothesis is they need vocabulalry and pronunciation instruction specifically tailored to the field of software engineering. Apps like Duolingo focus on generic language learning solutions so they teach beginners how to say "the cat is on the table" rather rather than "the pull request is closed". In short existing products in the market don't focus on the unique linguistic needs of software developers. I am building Voice Card to fill this gap by combining scientically proven spaced repitition methods with conversational AI.

For those that don't know, spaced reptition is a flashcard based system where the items you get wrong are the ones you review more often.

**Spanish-Speaking Developers in Latin America**
I decided to focus this app on Spanish-speaking software developers in Latin America. This is a massive and rapidly growing market. According to 2024 industry data, there are over 1.5 million Spanish-speaking developers in Latin America, with Mexico leading at 800,000, followed by Argentina at 167,000, and Colombia at 165,000 developers.

The so-called "nearshoring boom" is driving unprecedented demand. Remote applications from LatAm developers have increased by 285% in the last five years, and U.S. companies increased their year-over-year hiring in Latin America by 50% in 2023. This $20 billion market is growing at 9% annually, offering 50-60% salary savings compared to U.S. tech hubs.

It is also true that this global economic phenomenon also offers significant opportunties for Latam Engineers, but many times, only for those can communicate effectively in English. In fact, nearly half of Latin American engineers prioritize language learning opportunities over technical learnings. Everyone knows, speaking proficiency in English directly correlates with career advancement and access to higher-paying international opportunities.

**Final Message (30 seconds)**
For Voice Card, I'm not trying to replace spaced repetition, and I'm not trying to create an all encompassing app that promoises to deliver fluency in the shortest amount of time possible. Instead I'm taking a battle tested, science based technique that millions of learners use every day to learn vocabulalry, and trying to make it more engaging with conversational AI.
