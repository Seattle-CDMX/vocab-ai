**Brief Hook (20 seconds)**  
Any developer, who doesn't speak English as their native language, can write a perfect email or slack message using LLLMs. Reading and listening? No problem. They've already spent hours pouring over documentation and watching technical tutorials in English.

For developers competing for jobs in Mexico and other countries where English is not the primary language, what really sets people apart—or holds them back—is speaking. If you want to double your salary, you need to master spoken English. That’s why I built VoiceCard: to help developers break through the speaking barrier and unlock the next level in their careers.

**User Persona**
**User Persona (30 seconds)**  
Meet Roberto, a 29-year-old React Native engineer from Oaxaca, Mexico. He’s talented, ambitious, and dreams of working for a top U.S. tech company. Roberto reads and writes English every day—he’s great at understanding documentation and can chat on Slack without a problem. But when it comes to speaking, he freezes. He worries about his accent, gets stuck searching for the right words, and dreads video calls with international clients. Roberto knows that if he could speak English more confidently, he could land better jobs, lead projects, and double his salary. He just needs a way to practice real conversations, and efficiently level up his speaking and pronunciation



## [SLIDE 2: The Complexity of Phrasal Verbs] - The Problem (1:00)

**The Complexity Breakdown (1 minute)**
Phrasal verbs are complex. First, they're multi-word with multiple meanings - "to go on" can mean "to happen" or "to continue." Second, the parts don't equal the whole - "break up" meaning "end a relationship" has nothing to do with physically breaking something upward. Third, they have complex grammar rules - you can say "turn on the TV" or "turn it on," but you can't say "look it after" for "look after it." Finally, they're the secret sauce of spoken English - the difference between formal "Please tolerate the noise" and casual "Just put up with it."

**[SLIDE 3: The Language Learning Market] - Why Current Products Fall Short (0:45)**
Learning phrasal verbs is challenging, as is mastering vocabulary in any second language. Language schools typically focus on reading and grammar, providing insufficient instruction in vocabulary and speaking, let alone phrasal verbs.

Students often turn to flash card based apps like Anki or WaniKani for Japanese Kanji. However, these apps are text-only and lack AI features by default. Of course, there's Duolingo, but these kinds of apps are focused on comprehensive language learning solutions and leave opportunities open for other more niche apps.

I created VoiceCard to help language learners master phrasal verbs and English vocabulary by combining the proven method of spaced repetition with newer techniques in conversational AI.

## [SLIDE 4: First Target: Spanish-Speaking Developers in Latin America] - Target Audience (00:30)

I decided to focus this app on Spanish-speaking software developers in Latin America. This is a massive and rapidly growing market. According to 2024 industry data, there are over 1.5 million Spanish-speaking developers in Latin America, with Mexico leading at 800,000, followed by Argentina at 167,000, and Colombia at 165,000 developers.

The nearshoring boom is driving unprecedented demand. Remote applications from LatAm developers have increased by 285% in the last five years, and U.S. companies increased their year-over-year hiring in Latin America by 50% in 2023. This $20 billion market is growing at 9% annually, offering 50-60% salary savings compared to U.S. tech hubs.

However, a critical barrier remains: 45% of Latin American engineers prioritize language learning opportunities. While their technical skills are exceptional, speaking proficiency in English directly correlates with career advancement and access to higher-paying international opportunities. This is our target market.

## [SLIDE 5: Solution Demo] - Live Demo (4:30)

**Demo Transition (30 seconds)**
Now let me show you VoiceCard AI in action. I'm going to switch to a live screen share to demonstrate the actual product.

**[SWITCH TO SCREEN SHARE - LIVE DEMO: 5:00-8:00]**

*During live demo, showcase:*
- Voice card selection and context
- Real-time AI conversation 
- Spanish-specific explanations
- Immediate feedback system
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Progress tracking


**Final Message (30 seconds)**
For Voice Card, I'm not trying to replace spaced repetition, and I'm not trying to create an all encompassing app that promoises to deliver fluency in the shortest amount of time possible. Instead I'm taking a battle tested, science based technique that millions of learners use every day to learn vocabulalry, and trying to make it more engaging with conversational AI.
