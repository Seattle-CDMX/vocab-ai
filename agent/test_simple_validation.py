Simple test to verify that the Spanish validation now correctly accepts "cerrar un negocio" for "close down".
This tests just the validation prompt logic without requiring full agent instantiation.

Phrasal verb senses:
{senses_info}

BE EXTREMELY GENEROUS in evaluation. Accept Spanish translations that show ANY understanding.

Common Spanish translations to accept:
- "go on" = "continuar" or "pasar" 
- "pick up" = "recoger"
- "come back" = "regresar"
- "close down" = "cerrar" or "cerrar un negocio" (close a business)

For "close down" specifically: Accept ANY Spanish phrase about closing businesses, stopping operations, or shutting down.

Determine:
1. Is this response in Spanish? (yes/no)
2. If Spanish, which sense number does it correctly translate to? (1, 2, etc. or 'none' if incorrect)
3. Brief explanation of why

BE LENIENT - if there's any reasonable connection, mark it as correct!

Respond in JSON format:
{{"is_spanish": boolean, "correct_sense": number or null, "explanation": "brief explanation"}}
